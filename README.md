BER_DL_detector.py is the code used for detection of the received signal using the DL model with pre-trained(learned) weights.
The model is trained using the offline_training.py code which gets the model from func.py file
func.py contains the necessary functioins for the DNN model.
Other files are there containing functions required to run the OTFS code.
